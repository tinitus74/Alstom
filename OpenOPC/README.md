OpenOPC is a python library for OPC communication.

It is not working with S8000 because of parameters in the read or write functions in the S8000.

It is why I have modified (like a pig) the functions, just to use it with simple call to read or write one point in the S8000.

Please read the wiki to learn more about the installation which is not plain straight.
