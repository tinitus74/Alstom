# Alstom
Jobs for Alstom

You will find some information in the wiki.

Anyway let's talk about few points:
* we use OpenOPC for python library but we want to modify the library for S8000 spcecifically for write values
* we have developped an XLA for automatizing the scripts for Sikuli, using the mimics file to find objects in the HMI
* we have developped an alstom.py module to create Classes for using under the hood functions.

So in our alstom.py module we implement:
* sikuli low operations
* html report generation

Enjoy
